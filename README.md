XSetRootImage (XSRI): Fedora's Y2K-era wallpaper setter. Feh can set
the wallpaper too, but it can't specify colors or geometry.

It should build for the moment with autoconf ; ./configure ; make and
optionally make install. I'm not sure about the -lm, but I needed it.

I really appreciate this little program. As far as I know, only Gentoo
packages it anymore, and as such I tracked down the RPM from a Gentoo
distfiles mirror.
