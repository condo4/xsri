XSetRootImage (XSRI): Fedora's Y2K-era wallpaper setter with more features
than you care about. Feh can do some of these things but it can't specify
colors or geometry as efficiently, if at all.

It should build for the moment with autoconf ; ./configure ; make and
optionally make install. I'm not sure about the -lm, but I needed it.

I really appreciate this little program. As far as I know, only Gentoo
packages it anymore, and as such I tracked down the RPM from a Gentoo
distfiles mirror.
